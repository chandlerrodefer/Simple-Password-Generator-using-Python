<h1>SIEM-Home-Lab</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I set up a SIEM (Azure Sentinel) and connected it to an active VM (acting as my honeypot). Using this, I was able to monitor live attacks (Brute Forcing RDP) globally. I used a custom PowerShell script to search for the attackers' geographic location and created an Azure Sentinel map using this data.
